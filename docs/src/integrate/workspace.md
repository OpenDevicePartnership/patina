# Workspace Setup

This section will go over how to set up your workspace to be able to compile the Rust DXE Core.
Two methods of doing so are supported; The first is to compile the binary in a separate repository
and provide it to the platform as a standalone EFI. The second is to have it build as a part of the
EDKII build system. Please review one of the two options depending on your goal:

1. [Compiling Locally](integrate/compile_local.md)
1. [Compiling Externally](integrate/compile_external.md)
