# Integration Testing

Integration testing is very similar to unit testing, however each test is placed in a `tests/*`
folder at the same file directory level as `src/*`. When writing tests of this manner, the
developer does not have access to the internal state of the module. Only the external interfaces
are being tested. `Cargo` will detect and run these tests with the same command as for unit tests.

See the cargo book entry on [Integration Testing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/testing/integration_testing.html).

Here is an example file structure for a crate that contains integration tests:

```
├── src
|    └── main.rs
├── tests
|    ├── integration_test1.rs
|    └── integration_test2.rs
├── .gitignore
└── Cargo.toml
```
