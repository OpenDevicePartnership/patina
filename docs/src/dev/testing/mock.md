# Mocking

Mocking is supported through the [mockall](https://crates.io/crates/mockall) crate. This crate provides multiple ways
to mock throughout your crate including:

- [Mocking Local Traits](https://docs.rs/mockall/0.13.0/mockall/index.html#getting-started)
- [Mocking External Traits](https://docs.rs/mockall/0.13.0/mockall/index.html#external-traits)
- [Mocking Structs](https://docs.rs/mockall/0.13.0/mockall/#mocking-structs)
- [Mocking Modules](https://docs.rs/mockall/0.13.0/mockall/index.html#modules)
- [Mocking FFI Functions](https://docs.rs/mockall/0.13.0/mockall/index.html#foreign-functions)

This documentation will not go into the specifics of any of those as the `mockall` crate itself has a large amount of
documentation for each, and has [Examples](https://docs.rs/mockall/0.13.0/mockall/index.html#examples) on how to do
these different types of mocking.
