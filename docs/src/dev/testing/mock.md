# Mocking

Mocking is supported through the [`mockall`](https://crates.io/crates/mockall) crate. This crate provides multiple
ways to mock throughout your crate, including:

- [Mocking Local Traits](https://docs.rs/mockall/latest/mockall/index.html#getting-started)
- [Mocking External Traits](https://docs.rs/mockall/latest/mockall/index.html#external-traits)
- [Mocking Structs](https://docs.rs/mockall/latest/mockall/#mocking-structs)
- [Mocking Modules](https://docs.rs/mockall/latest/mockall/index.html#modules)
- [Mocking FFI Functions](https://docs.rs/mockall/latest/mockall/index.html#foreign-functions)

> **Note:** This documentation does not cover the specifics of each approach, as the `mockall` crate itself has
> extensive documentation and [examples](https://docs.rs/mockall/latest/mockall/index.html#examples) for different
> types of mocking.
