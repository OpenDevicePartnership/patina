# Writing Tests

Another benefit of rust is that testing is "baked-in" and made easy. There is plenty of
documentation regarding testing for rust, so if you don't know much about testing in rust, start
with that and come back here. We will stick to what is directly applicable to this project.

Testing in rust can be broken up into three core categories: (1) Unit testing, where the developer
has access to the internal, private state of the module to ensure the internals work as expected.
(2) Integration Testing, is done outside of the module and tests the code from an external
interface standpoint. (3) Platform Testing - e.g. writing DXE_DRIVERs that perform tests on a 
physical or virtual platform. (4) Doc testing, is a testing type that is covered in [Documentation](documenting.md),
but suffice it to say that code snippets for inline documentation can be compiled and executed.

In Rust, this is done by writing unit tests directly in the source file itself,
and integration tests in a standalone file in a `tests/*` folder of the crate.

## Development Dependencies

Rust has the concept of `dev-dependencies` that can be specified in a crate's `Cargo.toml` file.
These dependencies are only used in the writing and running of tests, and thus will only be
downloaded and compiled for test execution. One common example, as specified in the rust book
(linked at the chapter start) is `pretty_assertions` which extends the standard assertions to
create a colorful diff.

## Code Coverage

Code coverage is another incredibly important aspect of our project, that was
lacking in other projects. Our intent is to keep above 80% code coverage for
all crates in any given repository. We use [Cargo Tarpaulin](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-tarpaulin)
as our code coverage reporting tool as it works well with windows and Linux,
and can generate different report types. Each repository must have CI that
fails if any code added to the repository has less than 80% coverage, or the
repository as a whole is less than 80% coverage.
