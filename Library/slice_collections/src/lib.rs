//! A library containing multiple `no_std` data structures where the core data is stored as a slice
//! that is provided by the caller. The currently supported data structures are a
//! [Binary Search Tree](Bst), a [Red-Black Tree](Rbt), and a [Sorted Slice](SortedSlice).
//! The sorted slice is preferred for it's size and speed when when working with either a small
//! number of elements or when the elements themselves are small. The BST and RBT are preferred
//! in all other cases, with the RBT being the preferred choice when the number of elements is
//! expected to be large.
//!
//! We use a custom `SliceKey` trait for sorting the elements in the data structures. A blanket
//! implementation is provided for all types that implement the `Ord` trait, however the user can
//! implement the trait for their own types to provide a different key for sorting, than the type
//! itself.
//!
//! ## Benchmarks
//!
//! There are currently some benchmarks available in the `benches` directory. These benchmarks
//! test the performance of the data structures with 4096 entries of 32bit, 128bit, and 384bit
//! index sizes respectively. The tests are as follows:
//!
//! - Insertion: Time to completely fill the data structure with random numbers.
//! - Search: Time it takes to search for every element in the data structure once.
//! - Delete: Time it takes to delete every element in the data structure.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use slice_collections::{Bst, Rbt, SortedSlice, SliceKey, node_size};
//!
//! const MAX_SIZE: usize = 4096;
//!
//! let mut mem_bst = [0; MAX_SIZE * node_size::<u32>()];
//! let mut bst: Bst<u32> = Bst::new(&mut mem_bst);
//!
//! let mut mem_rbt = [0; MAX_SIZE * node_size::<u32>()];
//! let mut rbt: Rbt<u32> = Rbt::new(&mut mem_rbt);
//!
//! let mut mem_ss = [0; MAX_SIZE * core::mem::size_of::<u32>()];
//! let mut ss: SortedSlice<u32> = SortedSlice::new(&mut mem_ss);
//!
//! let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
//! for num in nums {
//!     bst.add(num).unwrap();
//!     rbt.add(num).unwrap();
//!     ss.add(num).unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
